# Favorite Board Games @ the Guild!

Here at the guild we're generally pretty big on board games. There's a lot of reason for this! First, games are awesome. Second, there are SO MANY now, during this Golden Age of Board games ... there's generally a flavor of game for all types and situtations.

They're also good for the following reasons - they're fun! They're great for networking - creating a situation to hangout that isn't dependent on food or alcohol, and can fit a wide variety of time spaces. Also, they're super awesome for helping develop problem solving skills, and also soft skills!
